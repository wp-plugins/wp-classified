The plugin has been successfully tested on Wordpress version 3.1 with default and unchanged Permalink structure. It may work with earlier versions too, but I have not tested yet.

Please test the plugin with your theme on a test or a local machine, if the test is successful, then install it on the production machine.

Please make a backup of files and database and test this plugin before using it in production.
Please test the plugin on your local machine before you install it in your production environment.

Once again, I take no responsibility...

The below section describes how to install the plugin and get it to work.

Please test the plugin with your theme on a test machine or a local machine,

wp-content/public/wp-classified/

and chmod the public and cache directories to 777 (writable by the webserver.)

To support Permalink structure:
Example for htaccess code to redirect to wpClassified

You need an .htaccess file that is created/modified by wordpress via the Permalink/mod-rewrite option. 

By using the "/%postname%/" or "/%category%/%postname%/" as permalink
structure the plugin must work correctly and you do not need change anything.

For something else please edit the .htaccess file in the root folder of your Wordpress.
You can edit the .htaccess file by FTP.
You use the default .htaccess file and modify the file as follow:
The redirect should look something like this

### DO NOT touch your .htaccess file. ###
### By default, you do not need to touch the .htaccess file. ####

# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
###
#RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
###
RewriteRule !classified/ /index.php [L]
RewriteRule ^classified/([^/\(\)]*)/?  /index.php?pagename=classified [QSA,L,R,NS]
</IfModule>
# END WordPress
